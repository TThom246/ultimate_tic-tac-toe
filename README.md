# ultimate_tic-tac-toe
Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a game developed by mathematicians where every quadrant of a tic-tac-toe board contains another tic-tac-toe board. It plays almost identical, except that each player determines which tic-tac-toe board their opponent will play in. If Player 1 is in the bottom left tic-tac-toe board and places an "X" in the top left corner, then their opponent now must play on the top left tic-tac-toe board. This program allows for two individuals to play against each other or allows one player to play against an AI. This was originally developed in C++ and will now be remade in Rust along with a better AI implementation.
